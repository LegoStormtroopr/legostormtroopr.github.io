[This is a pretty great article](https://www.databaselabs.io/blog/Startup-ideas-are-worthless-execution-is-everything) that resonates with me. I won't go so far as to paraphrase the whole thing,
you should read it, but it can be summed up by its headings:

* If you're the only one with that idea... something's wrong.
* You are (probably) not a unique snowflake
* Be the Google in your market.

If you have a truely new idea, it probably means that you have encountered such a fundamental shift that will
encounter insane amounts of resistance and you need to work extra hard just to get people to see the benefit
of your product/idea/whatever.

That said, even then if you find this new turf sharing your idea early is a means to get feedback and building
something grand. Even if others know what you are doing, if its a great idea its unlikely that others will beat
you to market just because they will need time to catchup.
