To help with the promotion and assist in the education of new users of the DDI and SDMX standards I have put together a selection of posters and promotional material for downloading and sharing within the community.

**Visualising the power of DDI-Lifecycle**

While the Data Documentation Initiative standards are becoming widely adopted, they are not so well known that how they can be used is common knowledge. This poster is meant to serve as a gentle introduction to what metadata can be managed within DDI. By showing how DDI relates to a familiar object in social science – the questionnaire – we can provide a gentle introduction to what DDI is, so we can talk about how it can be used.

To get a custom poster based on your own survey or questionnaire email sam@odaf.org.
