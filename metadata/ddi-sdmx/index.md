Some time ago I fell into the niche overlap of statistics, data management and computer programming. At the intersection of these three fields are two standards and [one confused guy from Australia](http://www.kidstrythisathome.com/about/ "About Me").

A lot of the work and research I do into open standards revolves around using DDI and SDMX for data capture and sharing. If you have issues working with these standards and are in Canberra, I&#8217;m probably as good person to talk to as I&#8217;m pretty experienced with them, and usually have lots of free time to sit down, drink beer and discuss data.

**Data Documentation Initiative (DDI)** is an effort to create an international standard for describing data from the social, behavioral, and economic sciences. Expressed in [XML](http://www.w3.org/XML/), the DDI metadata[specification](/specification) now supports the entire research data life cycle. DDI metadata accompanies and enables data conceptualization, collection, processing, distribution, discovery, analysis, repurposing, and archiving. (from the [DDI Website](http://www.ddialliance.org "DDI Alliance Website"))

**Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange (SDMX)** is an initiative to foster standards for the exchange of statistical information. (From the [SDMX Website](http://sdmx.org/ "SDMX Website"))
