One of my core professional interests now is metadata and metadata management.

Apart from being involved in the [DDI/SDMX community](/metadata/ddi-sdmx/) is also
developing open sources solutions for metadata management.

Another project I've been involved in is the development of data exploration tools
for the [django framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

* [Django spaghetti and meatballs](https://github.com/LegoStormtroopr/django-spaghetti-and-meatballs) is an app for converting django data models into UML diagrams
* [Django Data Interrogator](https://github.com/LegoStormtroopr/django-data-interrogator) is a app for performing data analysis on django databases.
