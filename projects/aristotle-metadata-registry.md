The [Aristotle MetaData Registry](https://github.com/aristotle-mdr/aristotle-metadata-registry) is an project I&#8217;ve been working on to build an easy to use ISO/IEC 11179 enterprise level metadata registry using a free open-source framework and toolkit to provide the maximum benefit at the minimum cost for government, volunteer and not-for-profit organisations in the health, survey research and statistics domains.

The [source code is available on github](https://github.com/aristotle-mdr/aristotle-metadata-registry), and [the complete documentation is available courtesy of ReadTheDocs](http://aristotle-metadata-registry.readthedocs.org/). The [initial post I made launching Aristotle gives more background on its features and benefits](http://www.kidstrythisathome.com/2015/02/aristotle-metadata-registry-my-worst-kept-secret/ "Aristotle-Metadata-Registry – My worst kept secret"), and a [demonstration site is hosted at Aristotle.PythonAnywhere.com](http://aristotle.pythonanywhere.com).
