Its been a while since my last post, and while a few emails and updates to GitHub have happened, I haven&#8217;t written a formal announcement here. The big news of which two releases of the Canard Question Module Editor have been published and made available.

[Version 0.2 went out on October 1st and Version 0.2.1 went out on the 9th.](http://bit.ly/canard_releases) Normally, there&#8217;d be a larger gap between releases, however, very shortly after version 0.2 went out the door a handful of troublesome bugs were discovered regarding the handling of multilingual text. So a second version went out the door very shortly after that included some bug fixes and some new features tht made dealing with multiple languages easier.

Additionally, the [QFingerTabsWidget that was discussed in an earlier post](http://www.kidstrythisathome.com/2013/03/fingertabs-horizontal-tabs-with-horizontal-text-in-pyqt/ "“FingerTabs” – Horizontal Tabs with Horizontal Text in PyQt"), has seen a number of updates to allow for icons and a more responsive design of horizontal text in horizontally aligned tabs. This has become larger than just a gist and will in the coming weeks be spun of into its own GitHub repository.

Lastly, with Canard in a relatively stable state, and with the &#8220;plug-in architecture&#8221; in a usable state I&#8217;m going to focus on creating SQBL transformations for input, output and visualisation. So suggestions for target formats and languages, or [updates or changes to existing plugins](http://bit.ly/1cFTrea) would be welcome in the comments.

If anyone is interested in following updates to SQBL or Canard, I&#8217;d strongly recommend following the [SQBL Mailing lists](http://bit.ly/SQBL_ml) to keep up to date with releases and new plugins as they are published.
