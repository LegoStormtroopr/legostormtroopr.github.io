So in the midst of preparing for Cornell, Uni work and wedding planning I haven&#8217;t had time to update, but taking a breather in a beautiful hotel room is a perfect time to get back to blogging.

I arrived in Ithaca yesterday, the trip up way gorgeous. I would say pun intended, but I didn&#8217;t know Ithaca was famous for it gorges until I got here. Spend the afternoon with folks from the [DDI Alliance Expert Committee](http://www.ddialliance.org/). That was great, didn&#8217;t say much, but listening to some extraordinarily smart people and having them do the same to me was honouring. Sadly after dinner I had to retire with a killer fog of jetlag and nearly immediately fell asleep.

This morning was much more eventful, the lovely staff at the [Statler Hotel](http://www.statlerhotel.cornell.edu/) were able to get me a cord to charge my camera with, and with that I set off to explore the campus and surrounds. I walked round the [campus](http://picasaweb.google.com/theodore.therone/CornellCampus) before setting off for Collegetown. As my camera only had a short charge all my shorts of Collegetown are on my phone, whose cord is absent, so until I find it or figure out how to get the shots off, no photos from there yet.

But thats ok, as the best shots were down by [Casadilla Gorge](http://picasaweb.google.com/theodore.therone/CornellGorge). The shots were great, and by the bend down the end there is (according to locals) aÂ little wading area. The track along the creak from there was spectacular and green after last nights rain.

The only downside is a twisted my ankle some time during the walk, but I&#8217;m all strapped up, about to head of for lunch and see Jeremy Iverson from [Algenta](http://www.algenta.com/) talk about Colectica.
