One of the topics for discussion during the DDI Developers meeting was a lack of space for examples of actual DDI code. I hope to fix this problem through a [new Google Code repository for DDI Examples](http://code.google.com/p/ddi-examples/ "DDI Examples repository"). While a little sparse at the moment, I know there are few other good examples of DDI metadata available for people to contribute.

At the moment there are two ways that this can be done: I can either make volunteers permanent contributors to the repository so they can share files directly, or people are free to raise tasks and files can be uploaded by myself or another contributor.

I have also split the repository at the moment into three sections:

  1. **Simple Examples**: used to illustrate a simple concept or use case &#8211; such as a Question, Concept or Study &#8211; but not ideal for actual implementation.
  2. **Complex Examples**: to demonstrate more complex ideas, such as referencing, packaging or schemes.
  3. **Practical Examples**: highly complex examples that replicate an actual problem or real world scenario completely.

At the moment, there are only two files up on the site &#8211; the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industry Classification and the Australian Drugs of Concern Classification. Both of these were generated using Virgil-UI and have had some minor tweaks applied to they are DDI3.1 valid.

With time, I hope this can be a comprehensive resource allowing users easy access to DDI example to lower the barrier to entry to the standard.
