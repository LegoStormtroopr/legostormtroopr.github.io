Just a nice and quick update to show off the latest addition to Canard. Post-IASSIST I&#8217;ve been working on getting a [CS-Pro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSPro "Wikipedia CSPro page") to SQBL converter. As a part of this I needed to actually install CSPro, and it turns out it has some pretty cool features. Not least of which was the ability to view and editor (in a simple way) all of the questions in a block.

In the words of Steves Jobs (and many, many others), _Good Artists Borrow, Great Artists Steal_, and I worked about implementing this in Canard. Below is a screenshot of the new Canard &#8220;Bulk Question Editor&#8221; accessible when you click on the &#8220;Flow Logic&#8221; of a module.

At this stage this change has been checked into the [Canard GitHub](https://github.com/LegoStormtroopr/canard "Canard GitHub") for testing and will be rolled into the next release of Canard, which will be out&#8230; soon.
