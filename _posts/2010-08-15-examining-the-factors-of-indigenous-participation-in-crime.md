Thats the gist of my statistics thesis thats taking up so much of my time right now.

I&#8217;m currently working with Anna Ferrante from the UWA Crime Research Centre on a project to examine some Australian Bureau of Statistics data from 2008. Currently reading my way through reams of papers on the subject and so far the answer is a resounding &#8220;we don&#8217;t quite know.&#8221;Â

Or more the fact that there is no real easy answer. The combination of social biases, along with substance abuse and socioeconomic inequities all contribute from the base reading of done.

The bad news from this perspective is that at the moment there appears to be no silver bullet for this hot button issue.

However, with the untouched data of over 13,000 anonymised persons at my fingertips I can only hope that this analysis proves to be helpful to this already wide body of research.

And with any luck I will get a chance to carry some of this experience to when I start my Masters in Statistics.
