As is quite obvious, this site has changed layout for the first time in many years.

Its been shifted away from Wordpress and is now a Jekyll-powered github hosted blog.
The change is in part due to some learning from a side project, and in part because it was in dire need of a refresh.

A few things I've learned from this are:

* Learning a new platform is always educational
* Markdown is easier than HTML and is closer to how I think as a programmer, so a blog that supports that is great.
* Minimalism is so in right now.

Hopefully all this means more writing, especiallally about the work on 
[Aristotle Metadata Registry side and blog](https://github.com/aristotle-mdr/aristotle-metadata-registry/), 
but also with other metadata and programming issues I've been tackling.

For the time being [the old site is still accessible on nearlyfreespeech](http://kidstrythisathome.nfshost.com/),
but will be going down in a month or so and I'll be migrating the sandbox projects soon after. If you notice anything missing or find any broken links
