After a weekend spent literally fighting to get multilingual support working for me in Python and Qt, Virgil-UI now has wide ranging support for multiple languages &#8211; both in the editor and importing from CSVs with unusual character sets.

With this, and the previously unmentioned drag and drop support for reordering classifications, Virgil is approaching a point where it is almost ready for beta testing. In the coming week, I&#8217;ll be making a few small tweaks, along with a demonstration video. Hopefully, by early September it should be packaged up as a beta, for widespead testing amongst the DDI community &#8211; just in time for the close of submissions for this years [European DDI Users meeting](http://www.iza.org/conference_files/EDDI2011/call_for_papers "EDDI 2011").

Below are a few screenshots showing of the two main multilingual support features in Virgil-UI &#8211; the ability to add and edit the labels and descriptions of codes, and the ability to view the classification tree in any language that has been added.

Along with all of these changes a number of bugs in the CSV to DDI import tool have been corrected and I&#8217;ll be pushing out an updated Windows binary of that alongside the main release of Virgil-UI.

    Users can even select which language they want the tree structure of the classification to be displayed in.
