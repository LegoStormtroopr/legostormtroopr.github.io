Just a quick update that was supposed to have gone up last night. There is a [video up on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzyQiFjaFFQ) now, showing of some of the more finalised features of Virgil-UI.



This shows three big features &#8211; CSV import, drag-and-drop reordering of classifications and multilingual support for editing. This means a classification with a multilingual component, for example a Canadian Industry Classification could have the English and French components edited simultaneously.

As stated in the last post, there should be a Windows binary release of a beta version of Virgil-UI and an updated version of the convertor tool should be released early September.
