edit: Soon as in today

Just a quick reminder if people weren&#8217;t sure, but Jenni and I are off trekking across Europe for the next 3 weeks.

We&#8217;ll be going through about 8 countries, seeing various towers and cultural landmarks, several long train rides and Norwegian fjord boat cruise.

Plus I&#8217;ll be in Utrecht for EDDI. Fun times, see you all in about 3 weeks.
