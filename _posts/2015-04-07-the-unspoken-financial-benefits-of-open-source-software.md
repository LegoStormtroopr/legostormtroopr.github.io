I have been recently been applying for support from an employer for travel funding to attend [the 2015 IASSIST conference](http://iassist2015.pop.umn.edu/) to present the [Aristotle Metadata Registry](https://github.com/aristotle-mdr/aristotle-metadata-registry) and after adding up the cost, I started thinking about the benefits that would justify this expense.

I&#8217;ve had two people offer to provide translation for Aristotle-MDR and I started considering the unaccounted for benefits I&#8217;ve already received. For arguments sake, lets consider a typical conference registration cost of $500 (AUD or USD) with accommodation and travel being another $1000. For attendance to be beneficial, you&#8217;d want to be able to see at least $1500 in return.

I started by looking at professional translation costs, which can cost as high as $100 per hour. So, if translating a portion of the project takes an hour, for the two languages that are (or will soon be) available, I can say that Aristotle has received about $200 of volunteer effort. With this in mind, I started thinking about how little support needs to be rallied to quickly provide a return on an investment in attending a conference.

If we consider freelancer developers can be hired for about $50, this means that for our conference, we&#8217;d need to get around 30 hours of work &#8211; not a small amount, especially when done for free. But broken down across multiple attendees this shrinks dramatically. If a talk is able to encourage moderate participation from as little as 3 people in an audience, this becomes 10 hours of work. Spread again across the course of a year, this is under an hour a month!

Given the rough numbers above, convincing 3 attendees to provide an hour of work a month gives a very rough approximate of $1800 of service &#8211; **a 20% return on investment**.

Along with programming or user interface development, there are other metrics when calculating the value generated from open-source. As a developer, I know the intrinsic value of a well written bug report, so even discovered bugs that lead to improvements are highly valuable for a project. This means that numbers of filed and closed bugs can be used as a rough metric (albeit a very, very rough metric) for positive contributions.

Ultimately, while there are strong ideological reasons for contributing to open-source, when developing for open-source projects within a business context these need to be offset with solid financial rational.
