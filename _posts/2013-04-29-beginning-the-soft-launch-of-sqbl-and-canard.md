Over the past week I&#8217;ve start finalising a version of Canard and SQBL ready for early-Beta testing and public review ahead of [IASSIST2013](http://www.iassist2013.org/ "IASSIST2013"). While I&#8217;ll be putting together more documentation later in the week, the first of a series of short tutorials on how Canard will eventually be used.

Also, later this week will see the source code for Canard as shown in the below video released on GitHub, as well as a beta binary for easy of use during testing. For now the [SQBL schemas can be seen on GitHub](https://github.com/LegoStormtroopr/sqbl-schema "SQBL Schema") and the [main SQBL website](http://sqbl.org "SQBL") contains more information. For now, enjoy the two videos below to see how a strict structure can make questionnaire design easier than ever before!
