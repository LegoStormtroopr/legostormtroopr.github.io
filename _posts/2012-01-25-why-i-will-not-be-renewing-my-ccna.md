A little over three years ago I was a programmer in the Network Services department of a very successful internet services provider. As a part of my career advancement it was recommended that I study pursue some certification. Working with very skilled network engineers the obvious choice was to study for a Cisco Certification &#8211; one of the most common IT certifications available. Over two months of extremely intense study I was able to pass both exams and become a Cisco Certified Networking Associate. I was able to better understand my collegues and improve my understanding of fundamental networking.

Flash forward to now &#8211; I&#8217;ve long since left that job, now working as an Information Analyst for the Australian Government. Most of my work in business analysis and theoretical computer science. I barely even administer my own home network and have forgotten most of what I know about networking.

So why am I not renewing my CCNA?

Because it is intellectually dishonest. At the time, when I got certified, I got it as a proof of my understanding or at least ability to understand. While my career was still in its infacy, this helped demonstrate my capability. Now however, I have experience as a programmer and analyst, but no longer working with networking.

Certification is in essence two things: a resume substitute for experience and proof of ability. If I was to renew my certification (which would require quite a bit of relearning) it would only be a disadvantage, for me and for every other person with a CCNA accreditation. If in the future I was hired on the basis of my accreditation I would soon be found out as someone who is now relatively unskilled with networks, which would only make me look bad. Worse though is that by me, or anyone, who holds an accreditation without appropriate experience or skill only make everyone else who holds that certification look bad by comparison, by the reducing the surety of the accreditation as an indicator of that skill.

As such, holding any certificate without the appropriate skill to back it up is both not in my own self-interest and morally bankrupt.
