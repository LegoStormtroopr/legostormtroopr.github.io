So my latest literary outing was a re-read of Aldous Huxley&#8217;s &#8220;Brave New World&#8221;. While, there are tons of reviews that do a great job of comparing Huxley&#8217;s Brave New World with Orwells 1984 and our current surveillance state, there is one short passage from late in the book, that resonated with me this read through.

> One of the principal functions of a friend is to suffer (in a milder and symbolic form) the punishments that we should like, but are unable, to inflict upon our enemies.

In the midst of a long essay on the dangers of giving ourselves over to technological advances, this quote is hidden and is, I think, one of the better, albeit more cynical, descriptions of friendship I have read.
