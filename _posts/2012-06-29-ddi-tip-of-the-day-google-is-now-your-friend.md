A relatively recent, but unadvertisted change to the [A relatively recent, but unadvertisted change to the](http://www.ddialliance.org) was the inclusion of a link to the [Field Level Documentation](http://www.ddialliance.org/Specification/DDI-Lifecycle/3.1/XMLSchema/FieldLevelDocumentation/) on the front page. This small change has allowed the search engine web crawlers to mine through the Field Level Documentation, which has made the documentation much easier to search through.

So if you are looking for information on a DDI element, attribute, scheme or phrase something else in the XML schema itself, a simple search for &#8220;DDI&#8221; and your search term should bring up exactly what you want, like so:

[<img class="alignnone  wp-image-534" title="Searching for a DDI ControlConstruct" src="http://www.kidstrythisathome.com/wp-content/uploads/ddi_search.png" alt="" width="628" height="653" />](http://www.kidstrythisathome.com/wp-content/uploads/ddi_search.png)

Beware that sometimes Google might try and be helpful and split an element into separate words and give you incorrect search results, for example giving results for &#8220;DDI _Control Construct_&#8221; instead of &#8220;_DDI ControlConstruct_&#8220;. However, all you need to do is wrap the element name in quotes and it should give you better answers.
