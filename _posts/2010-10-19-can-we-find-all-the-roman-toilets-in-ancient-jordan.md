So Sam, what exactly do you do at uni?

Well, I&#8217;m glad you asked hypothetical reader, [I solve practical problems](http://www.teamfortress.com/engineer.htm). For example, for the last 2 months I along with 5 of my peers have been working with the Archaeology department at the University of Western Australia to design a tool to help field researchers track and visualise dig sites using Google Earth.

This work appears to have caught the eye of the publishing group at UWA and it was [mentioned in a recent edition of the UWA News](http://uwanews.publishing.uwa.edu.au/?f=284022).

The tool will allow researchers to track and upload site information (including such information as &#8220;was this site a toilet&#8221;) via a webpage and have this be instantly viewable back here by researchers at UWA. So yes, in the near future UWA researchers will be able to easily find out where ancient Romans pooped when they were holidaying in Jordan!
