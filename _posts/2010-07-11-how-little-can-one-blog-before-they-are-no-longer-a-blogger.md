I really should keep on top of this blog better, I have 3 half finished drafts of posts that I still haven&#8217;t gotten around to finishing, mostly for silly reasons like lack of time or sleep or appropriate photos to go with them.

  * Updates in my life since the last post:
  * Exams are over,
  * Am now married,
  * Off to Thredbo in a few days for a week of snowboarding,
  * Have a major piece of work (for work) hosted and ready to demo when I get to Canberra,
  * Rewriting a perl/email/twitter gateway in python so its easier to distribute.

Fortunately, I will never have to plan a wedding again (which can be a massive time-sink (but worth it)), so I should be able to keep on top of this when I get back from the snow.
