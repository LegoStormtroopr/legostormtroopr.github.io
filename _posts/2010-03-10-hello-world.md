So I&#8217;ve started blogging again. Now that there is so much going on, I finally have something interesting to say, so I need a place to say it.

First event coming up, <a href="http://www.barcampperth.org/" target="_blank">Bar Camp 2010</a> in April. If you are going to be in Perth, come along, knowing who is organising it, I&#8217;m sure there will be a lot going on.

Check out the abstract for my talk <a href="http://barcampperth.org/talks/government-2-dot-0-open-source-at-the-australian-bureau-of-statistics" target="_blank">on the BarCamp site</a>.
