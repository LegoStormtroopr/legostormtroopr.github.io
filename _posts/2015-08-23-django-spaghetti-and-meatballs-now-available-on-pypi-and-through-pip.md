The title covers most of it: [django-spaghetti-and-meatballs (a little library I was making for producing entity-relationship diagrams from django models)](https://github.com/LegoStormtroopr/django-spaghetti-and-meatballs) is now [packaged and available on PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-spaghetti-and-meatballs), which means it can be installed via pip super easily:

`pip install django-spaghetti-and-meatballs`

There is even [documentation for django-spaghetti-and-meatballs available on ReadTheDocs](http://django-spaghetti-and-meatballs.readthedocs.org/en/stable/), so its all super stable and ready to use. So get it while its still fresh!

There is a [live demo on the Aristotle Metadata Registry site](http://aristotle.pythonanywhere.com/plate/), or you can check out the static version below:
