A short and sweet update:

There was an oversight with the CSV converter not converting coded values to the proper place in the created DDI XML. This has been fixed and the changes have been pushed into SVN and a new version [(0.0.2b)](http://code.google.com/p/virgil-ui/downloads/detail?name=virgil-csv-converter_v0.0.2b.zip "Virgil c2d 0.0.2b - Google Code") of the executable has been [released on Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/virgil-ui/downloads/list "Virgil c2d - Google Code").
